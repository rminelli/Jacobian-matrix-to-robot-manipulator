# Jacobian-matrix-to-robot-manipulator
The Jacobian generalizes the gradient of a scalar-valued function of multiple variables, 
which itself generalizes the derivative of a scalar-valued function of a single variable. 
In other words, the Jacobian for a scalar-valued multivariate function is the gradient and that 
of a scalar-valued function of single variable is simply its derivative. The Jacobian can also be 
thought of as describing the amount of "stretching", "rotating" or "transforming" that a transformation imposes locally. 
For example, if (x′, y′) = f(x, y) is used to transform an image, the Jacobian Jf(x, y), describes how the image in the neighborhood 
of (x, y) is transformed.
